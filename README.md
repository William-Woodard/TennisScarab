This is my project for the extended project qualification. 
I originally made it as my CREST gold submission(You can see the report for this) but to extend it for the EPQ, I am planning on creating a custom HAT for the raspberry pi, getting rid of the wires everywhere and hopefully getting the automonous bit to work a lot better.
